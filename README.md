# FFXIVPosition
FFXIV Position Tool

Reads player position from a memory signature (that has managed to survive all of the major patches so far since 4.5) and "nudge" your character in a direction. Explore EVERYTHING! 

Of course if you ever reveal or make it obvious that you're modifying your character's position in memory you will be banned probably forever. So be smart.

Add the Memory.dll nuget package to build.
